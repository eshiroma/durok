#Durok score tracker

Durok is a game with only one loser, but no winners. Players (2-8) fight to get rid of their cards in a series of attacks and defends. The loser, who is the last one in the game with cards, is declared the "Durok" (Russian for "fool").

Although there is no such thing as winning a game, one can win in the rankings! Non-losses gain points, while losses lose points.

The score tracker front end states the game rules, presents player stats (in both table and chart form), and offers loss/not-loss ratio analysis for each player. Game data may be filtered by domain or date.
